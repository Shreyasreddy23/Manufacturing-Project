# Manufacturing-Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a **Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard** to track and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) across the production process.  
The aim is to identify bottlenecks, monitor rejections, measure efficiency, and provide actionable insights for process improvements.  

We implemented this using **SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI**, simulating a real-world business intelligence workflow.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Monitor **production performance** using KPIs.  
- Compare outputs, rejections, and wastage across employees, machines, and departments.  
- Provide visual insights to improve **quality & efficiency**.  
- Demonstrate **end-to-end BI implementation** using multiple tools.

## 📌 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
1. **Manufacture Qty** – Total items produced.  
2. **Rejected Qty** – Units failing quality checks.  
3. **Processed Qty** – Items completed in manufacturing stages.  
4. **Wastage Qty** – Materials/items lost during production.  
5. **Employee-Wise Rejected Qty** – Rejections by employees.  
6. **Machine-Wise Rejected Qty** – Rejections by machines.  
7. **Production Comparison Trend** – Production trend over time.  
8. **Manufacture vs Rejected** – Production vs rejection ratio.  
9. **Department-Wise Manufacture vs Rejected** – Department-level breakdown.
